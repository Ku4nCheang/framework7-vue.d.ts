# framework7-vue.d.ts
Typescript definitions for framework7-vue by iDangero.us

A work in progress.  Please help out.

As I understand it to work, maintaining this in the centralized @typings registry is more trouble than I'm willing to set up.  But you can still install it pretty easily like this:

```
npm install https://github.com/JasonKleban/framework7-vue.d.ts
```
